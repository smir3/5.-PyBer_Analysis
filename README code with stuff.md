# PyBer_Analysis

Overview of the Analysis

Purpose: It is my second week at my new job at PyBer, a python-based ride sharing app company valued at 2 billion dollars, as a Data Analyst. I have been tasked with
Analyze data on some large CSV files several types of visualizations will be created to tell a compelling story about the data. Write python scripts using pandas library, jupyter notebook and matplot lib to create a variety of charts that showcase the relationship between the type of city and the number of drivers and riders as well as the percentage of total fares, riders and drivers by type of city. The analysis and visualizations produced will help pyber improve accessabiltiy to ride sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighbourhoods

V. Isualize has given you and Omar a brand-new assignment. Using your Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, you’ll create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, you’ll create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, you’ll submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.
