# PyBer_Analysis

Overview of the Analysis

Purpose: It is my second week at my new job at PyBer, a python-based ride sharing app company valued at $2.3 billion dollars, as a Data Analyst. I have been tasked with
analyzing large CSV files containing data on the type of city, the number of drivers, and the number of riders. The analysis and visualizations produced will help PyBer improve accessabiltiy to ride sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighbourhoods. 

Task deliverables: I will use Python and Pandas to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, I will use Pandas and Matplotlib to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. The written report will summarize how the data differs by city type and how this information can be leveraged by decision-makers at PyBer.

There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type. (7 pt)

Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
